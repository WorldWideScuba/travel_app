# travel_app
A project to aggregate and display data relating to scuba sites around the world. This web app will attempt to be a prime resource for those looking to travel and scuba dive but aren't sure where to go. Eventually this project will be expanded to incorporate activities like mountain climbing and hiking.

This repo contains the Angular 6 front end. The java backend and postgres code are in separate repos.

*The backend node server connects to an Azure managed instance of PostgreSQL and without the connection variables (which I won't give you...haha) you wont be able to connect. This will mean that many of the api endpoints will fail to connect. You can enjoy the code though.*

## How to Run

1) Clone the repo onto your local machine

2) Install Nodejs and Angular CLI onto your machine

3) Using git Bash (or whichever command line tool you use) run the command npm install -g

4) To run Angular 6 front end, run the command 'ng serve'
